# Tehran

I have named this customization 'Tehran' because it evokes a sense of home, as Tehran happens to be my hometown.\
The desktop background showcases a picture of my neighborhood, adding a personal touch to the overall environment.\
Every time I use this setup, it brings me a comforting feeling of familiarity.

## Installation
To begin, right-click on the panel and select "Add Widgets...". Look for or install PlasmaConfigSaver.\
Next, save your current customization so that you can load it later if desired.

Afterward, you need to install and activate the Orchis Theme. You can find it [here](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme).\
Once Orchis theme is installed, set it as your "Global Theme" in "System Settings".\
Proceed to "System Settings" and search for "Application Style". Select "Configure GNOME/GTK Application Style" and choose Orchis from the options, or obtain it through the "Get New GNOME/GTK Application Style" option.

To install "Kvantum Manager", execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pamac install kvantum-manjaro
```
Change the theme to Orchis in Kvantum Manager.

Download the "Tehran.tar.gz" file and import it to PlasmaConfigSaver, and finally, load the customization.

Open "System Settings" and search for "Icons". I personally use Tela Circle from the [Tela Icone Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-icon-theme).

You can also customize your cursors. To do so, search for "Cursors" in "System Settings".\
Consider using [Vimix cursors](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Vimix-cursors) or [Whitesur cursors
](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-cursors) as they are good choices.

I recommend utilizing daily wallpapers.\
To set this up, right-click on the Desktop, select "Configure Desktop and Wallpaper...", choose "Picture of the Day" as the "Wallpaper type", and select your preferred provider.\
Personally, I use "Bing".
